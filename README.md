Use this metadata reader to search the metadata of this OpenITI release. 
If correctly installed within the folder that contains the release data,

## Release data: 

The release data (texts) itself can be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3082464#.Xt3s2zozZPY)

## To install the metadata reader:
